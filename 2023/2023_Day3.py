Line 1 ("0") should have a total of 0
Line 2 should add a total of 901
Line 3 should have a total of 901 + 783 + 855 = 2539
Line 4 ("3") should have a total of 2539 + 377 + 742 + 548 + 463 + 844 + 254 + 679 = 6446

In other words, it might work to look one line up for numbers, but not a line down.
Similarly, for numbers on current line, it makes sense to look up a line for a symbol, but not look down a line.
This could avoid double counting.
